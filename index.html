            <p>I have been learning more about:

            <h4>What am I learning in CSS?</h4>
            <p>
                A few years ago I took a web development course and flunked it.
                I am a hands-on tinkerer, so I jumped right into the coding exercises without reading about the concepts
                and rules.
                I spent hours debugging which eventually made me resent coding altogether. I've come back for a few more rounds of trials and error.
                This time around I started with the reading, videos, and explanations BEFORE jumping into the exercises. 
                Using an intro course to python, I jumped back into coding and now I love it and look forward to trying new tricks and skills.</p>

            <p>As of right now, I am adding to this website and still learning how to navigate and update documents in GitHub.</p>

        <div class="scripts">
            <h4>JavaScript, say what?!</h4>
            <p>I just learned how to use the type.js JavaScript library. The type.js library will type out
                different words for you like a typewriter. You can see my work at the top of this page! It took me
                a few weeks, a lot of questions, a lot of tinkering to figure it out. The most important lesson I
                keep learning is to never stop tinkering!</p>

            <h4>Motorcycle Life</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                   This summer of riding has been one for the books!
                    My best friend acquired her license and we have been riding togehter ever since!
                    I went moto camping for the first time and met a lot of great new people. 
                    I feel more confident in my riding skills and ability to be resourceful in tough times as I experienced a break down due to a
                    lost bolt from the gear connector to the primary. Luckily Harley Davidson on Baer in Pennsylvania saved my life by coming in 
                    in cluth with the bolt I needed to repair the bike and be on my way. 
                    Lots of lesson learned on the way for sure!
                    The season is not over so there will be one more riding update end of season, so stay tuned!
